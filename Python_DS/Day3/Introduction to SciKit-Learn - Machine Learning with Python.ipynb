    "In supervised learning, the algorithm learns on the labeled dataset, where the response is known. This acts as a ‘supervisor’ to train the model that provides an answer key that the algorithm can use to evaluate its accuracy on training data. This is used to predict the values for future or unseen data. This is when you know exactly what you want to predict — the target or dependent variable, and have a set of independent variables that you want to better understand in terms of their influence on the target variable. This is a task-driven technique.\n",
